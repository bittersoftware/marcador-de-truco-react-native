[![Google Play Store](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google_Play-414141?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-play&logoColor=white)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bittersoftware.marcadordetruco)

A mobile app built with React Native and Expo to keep score in games of "Truco," a popular card game. This app allows users to create new matches, track points, customize team names and avatars, and view their match history.

## Features

*   **Score Tracking:** Easily add and remove points for each team.
*   **Customizable Matches:** Set custom team names and choose from a selection of avatars.
*   **Match History:** Automatically saves a history of all completed matches for later review.
*   **Simple & Clean UI:** An intuitive and easy-to-use interface.

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
*   **Routing:** [Expo Router](https://expo.github.io/router/) for file-based navigation.
*   **Styling:** StyleSheet API with separated style files for each component.
*   **Linting & Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-oriented and scalable structure:

```

## Development

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   `npm` or `yarn`
*   A development build installed on your mobile device or a configured Android Emulator.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd MarcadorTruco
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App

*   **Start the development server and clear cache:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start --dev-client -c
    ```
    This connects to your development build.

*   **Run on a connected device/emulator:**
    ```bash
    npx expo run:android
    ```

## Build & Deployment

You can build the app locally for testing or use EAS Build for production releases.

### Prebuild (Optional)

To generate the native `android` and `ios` directories if you need to make native code changes:
```bash
npx expo prebuild --platform android
```

### Local Release Build

To create a release build on your local machine for testing:
```bash
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

### EAS Build (Recommended for Production)

This project uses [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas) to create builds for the app stores.

1.  **Install the EAS CLI:**
    ```bash
    npm install -g eas-cli
    ```

2.  **Log in to your Expo account:**
    ```bash
    eas login
    ```

3.  **Start a general build:**
    ```bash
    eas build
    ```

4.  **Start a production-specific Android build:**
    ```bash
    eas build -p android --profile production
    ```
    EAS will handle creating a new Android Keystore to sign your app if you don't have one. The build process will run on Expo's servers.

### Submitting to the Google Play Store

Once the build is complete, you will get a link to download the `.aab` (Android App Bundle) file.

1.  Go to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/).
2.  Navigate to your app and create a new release.
3.  Upload the `.aab` file you downloaded from EAS.
4.  Fill in the release details and roll it out to production.

Alternatively, you can use the EAS CLI to submit the build directly:
```bash
eas submit -p android --latest
```
